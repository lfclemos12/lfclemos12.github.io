# Luiz's Github Page

### Introduction
My name is Luiz Felipe Coelho Lemos, but most people just call me 'Luiz'. I'm a senior at CUNY Queen College majoring in Computer Science and have been selected for the 9th cohort of the CUNY Tech Prep program. My main programming interest is ML and specifically NLP. Some of my other hobbies include learning different languages and listening to jazz music. I'll be using this page to host projects during the upcoming year.
